# Spelling Game (WIP)

A clone of a popular word game written using vanilla HTML / JS / CSS.

This is a personal learning projectâ€”I'm trying out JS modules and web components to experiment with a web app architecture that doesn't use any libraries or tooling.

## Acknowledgements

- And of course the original game

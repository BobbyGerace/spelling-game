# Spelling Game (WIP)

A clone of a popular word game written using vanilla HTML / JS / CSS.

This is a personal learning project—I'm trying out JS modules and web components to experiment with a web app architecture that doesn't use any libraries or tooling.

## Acknowledgements

- [Common English Lexicon](https://github.com/Fj00/CEL), the source of the word list
- [Plain Vanilla Web](https://plainvanillaweb.com/), inspiration for many of the patterns employed here
- And of course the original game

## Running

```

# TODO

- [ ] Allow user to select letters arbitrarily
